# Image Classifier: Udacity Nanodegree - AI Programming with Python Final Project

An image classifier that identifies flower types in an image. I created this to learn numpy, matplotlib, jupyter notebooks, neural networks and machine learning with pytorch. It's the final project in the Udacity Nanodegree: AI Programming with Python.
