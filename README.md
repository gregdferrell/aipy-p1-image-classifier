# Image Classifier: Udacity Nanodegree - AI Programming with Python Final Project

An image classifier that identifies flower types in an image. I created this to learn numpy, matplotlib, jupyter notebooks, neural networks and machine learning with pytorch. It's the final project in the Udacity Nanodegree: AI Programming with Python.

# Getting Started
- Download [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) and unpack into the images directory using the [torchvision datasets format](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#datasetfolder). See images folder README for more details.
